Notes from Lisp with C Tutorial

A repository to store my notes from the book [Build Your Own Lisp With C.](http://www.buildyourownlisp.com/ "Build Your Own Lisp With C")

A lot of these notes are rewritten from the text for learning purposes and some are my own interpretation of the concepts and techniques. 
I attempted all Bonus Mark questions, as applicable. 

The completed code snippets and overall project will be updated at a later date.
